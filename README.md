# Article Preview Component

A clean, responsive card component built with **HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS** — part of my journey through [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges. This project helped me practice layout, spacing, typography, and responsive design using utility-first CSS.
